# 👁️ Eye — The Universal Interop Scripting Language

> **Write once. Eye sees it all.**

**Eye** is a lightweight, experimental scripting language built for *interop*. Whether it's Python talking to C#, a Typescript frontend syncing with a Rust backend, or your game engine nudging a database—Eye bridges them all using simple JSON and expression-first logic.

No classes. No indentation wars. No boilerplate. Just one interpreter file, and the freedom to wire up anything to anything.

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Cross-language interop** via shared JSON (`linkto`)
- 📄 **Simple file-based memory** (`_mem{}` and `host{}`)
- 🧠 **Polish notation** for fast logic & computation
- 🧰 **Built-in API requests** (`api(...)`)
- 🐞 **Debug tools** (`debug.msg(...)`, `debug.runs()`)
- 🧪 **One-file interpreter** written in Python—easily extensible
- ⚡ **No classes, no `main()`, no setup. Just run.**

## To Make a file
1. Create a new file called (something).eye
2. Write your code inside (write "helpme" for a guide on the language)
3. to run, run the interpreter and enter your file name
main.eye         # Your Eye code
data.json        # Your linked host file
